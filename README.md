# Python Practice Repository

This repository is a collection of small projects I'm working on to learn and practice Python.

## Projects

### Tower of Hanoi

This project implements the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. It includes both recursive and iterative solutions to the problem.

-   `Hanoi/Hanoi.py`: Main script for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
-   `Hanoi/Hanoi_recursion.py`: A recursive approach to solving the puzzle.

**What I learned:** This project helped me understand recursive functions and algorithmic thinking.

### Q&A Quiz

A simple command-line quiz game. It loads questions and answers from a JSON file and tests the user's knowledge on various topics.

-   `QA/QA_Quiz.py`: The main application for the quiz.
-   `QA/questions.json`: A JSON file containing the quiz questions, answers, and categories.

**What I learned:** This taught me how to work with JSON data, handle user input, and structure a simple command-line application, start to finish.
